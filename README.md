# About-Me
Whoami
# 👋 Hi, I'm Bisade (aka CyberBugShield)

I'm a passionate and hands-on Junior Cybersecurity Analyst, currently completing my AAS in Cybersecurity at CCBC and interning with Defiant (Wordfence). I specialize in Security Operations (SOC), log analysis, Linux-based threat response, and real-time monitoring tools.

## 🔐 Current Projects

🛡️ CyberBugShield (In Progress)
An AI-powered Bash framework for SOC analysts, featuring malware scanning, anomaly detection, real-time dashboards, GPG encryption, DNS tunneling detection, and CVE intelligence integration. Includes Telegram alerting, IoT vulnerability scans, and YARA matching.

📊 SOC-Practice Labs
Hands-on labs simulating SOC tasks using Splunk, Linux CLI, log correlation, audit monitoring, and incident response scenarios. Includes documentation of mock investigations and threat mitigation strategies.

🧠 Terracotta Bank Simulation
Performed network traffic interception and exploited authentication bypass vulnerabilities.  
Simulated a successful attack by removing funds from a random bank user account.  
Applied encryption techniques and used Wireshark to detect data leaks.

🌐 OWASP Juice Shop – Web App Pen Testing
Used Burp Suite and Kali Linux to identify and exploit XSS and SQL injection flaws. Practiced web app defense techniques and implemented patches to harden the system.

🏢 Enterprise Network Simulation (EVE-NG & VMware)
Designed a virtual enterprise using EVE-NG, Palo Alto firewalls, Windows Server (AD), and Ubuntu servers. Configured VLANs, VPNs, DHCP, SIEM tools, and conducted incident response drills.

🧩 Configure a System with Ansible
Automated remote Linux server management using Ansible ad-hoc commands. Configured SSH key-based authentication and verified automation for task deployment.

🧪 Metasploit Exploitation Lab
Simulated controlled attacks using Metasploit to understand vulnerabilities and exploit paths. Practiced remediation and mitigation steps in a safe environment.

🧷 Linux & Windows Hardening
Implemented OS hardening techniques: modified firewall rules, configured user permissions, disabled insecure services, and enforced access control policies.

🔬 Wireshark Packet Analysis
Captured and analyzed network packets to uncover signs of malicious traffic and identify protocol misuse and data leaks.

🔓 Ransomware Mitigation (AIG Simulation)
Used Python scripting to brute-force decrypt ransomware-encrypted files. Demonstrated recovery techniques without ransom payment, and documented incident analysis.

🛠️ Lead Generation Bot (Python)
Built a Python-based scraping tool to collect, filter, and validate business leads. Outputs data to Google Sheets and includes plans for CRM automation and SMTP testing.
